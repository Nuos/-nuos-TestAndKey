/**
 *  There are a few other important points to note in the code above.
 *
 *  The return value of fopen() is checked against null to ensure that the file was opened successfully.
 *  The code does not check that the call to fread() was successful and whether it returned the number of characters requested.
 *  The final element in the buffer array is set to 0 to ensure that the string is null-terminated, 
 *    prior to sending the result to the console using printf().
